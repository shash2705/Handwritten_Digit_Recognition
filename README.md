# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition

Objective
This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset or a similar digit dataset.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing:

The dataset undergoes cleaning and transformation, including normalization and reshaping, to prepare it for model training.

Model Development:

A neural network (likely built using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) is implemented to classify the digits.

Evaluation and Testing:

The model is tested for accuracy using unseen data to evaluate its performance.

Visualization:

Graphs and visualizations, including confusion matrices or sample predictions, help assess the model's success.
